<h3>Stripe Payment Configuration</h3>

If you do not have a Stripe account, please click the Connect button on the Additional Settings tab.<br/><br/>

2. Fill in the required fields with information provided in the Stripe dashboard.<br/>

When you connect, you can choose between Test or Live mode using the respective Connect button.

Before accepting payments, click "Request Access" next to the payment method you want to enable. You may need to provide additional information or agree to specific terms required by the scheme.<br />
<br />
Please note that some payment methods have additional requirements, such as a minimum order amount (e.g., Affirm requires a $50 minimum) or specific currencies and merchant locations (e.g., OXXO requires MXN currency, and Ideal/Sofort require EUR currency).<br /><br/>


5. Stripe payment options will appear at customer's checkout at storefront. <br/><br/>

6. Once orders are created using Stripe, you can perform capture, void, or refund actions in the Order section of the AbanteCart admin panel.<br/><br/>
