# 1. To use URL Aliases you need to be running apache with mod_rewrite enabled. 

# 2. In your abantecart main directory rename file htaccess.txt to .htaccess

# 3. Edit file .htaccess. If abantecart is installed in yourdomain/ subfolder change configuration line  RewriteBase /  to  RewriteBase /subfolder/.
# Example:  yourdomain.com/store   use RewriteBase/store/ 
# Important to have / at the end of the line.

# 4. if htaccess and mode_rewrite still does not works - check and set apache2 webserver directive AllowOverride All for your virtual hosts
